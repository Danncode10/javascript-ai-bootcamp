# JavaScript + AI Bootcamp

Welcome to my learning journey!
This is **Course 1** in my Full Stack Developer roadmap:
JavaScript → React → React Native → Node.js

## About This Course

This is a 2-week crash course that teaches the fundamentals of modern JavaScript — with the twist of using **AI tools** like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to speed up learning and debugging. The idea is simple: **Know the Code + Use AI**.

Perfect for beginners like me who learn slowly but deeply, with lots of hands-on practice and clear explanations.

## Course Structure

Week 1: JavaScript Foundations

* Variables, Data Types, Basic Operations
* Functions and Scope
* Arrays and Loops
* Objects and the DOM

Week 2: Intermediate JS + AI Workflow

* Conditions & Events
* Fetch API
* Mini Project: Profile Viewer App
* How to Use AI Effectively as a Developer

## What You'll Learn

* When to use `let`, `const`, and `var`
* How to write and call functions (normal and arrow)
* Understanding scope in JavaScript
* Working with arrays and loops like `.map()` and `.forEach()`
* Manipulating web pages with the DOM
* Making web requests with `fetch()`
* Building interactive web pages with events
* Using AI to write, debug, and refactor code

## Tools Used

* Visual Studio Code
* ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot
* Google Chrome DevTools
* Online editors (CodePen, JSFiddle, or Replit)

## Mini Projects Included

* Profile Card
* Calculator
* Grocery List
* Dynamic Web Message
* Grade Calculator
* Random Joke Fetcher
* Profile Viewer Web App

## Why I'm Doing This

I'm learning slowly but seriously. This course is the foundation for my goal of becoming a **full stack developer**. After this, I will move on to learning:

1. React (Frontend)
2. React Native (Mobile Apps)
3. Node.js (Backend)

This repo tracks my progress, projects, and code experiments. If you're also learning, feel free to fork or follow along!

## How I Use AI in This Project

* Ask ChatGPT for code snippets: “Write a JS function that…”
* Tweak and customize AI output
* Debug errors with AI help
* Refactor code for readability
* Learn to write better prompts

Let’s go step by step, and get better together.
