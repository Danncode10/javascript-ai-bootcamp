# JavaScript + AI Bootcamp

Welcome to my learning journey!  
This is **Course 1** in my Full Stack Developer roadmap:  
➡️ JavaScript → React → React Native → Node.js

---

## 📦 Prerequisite

This course builds on **basic UI skills using Bootstrap**.  
Make sure to complete [Course 0: Bootstrap Refresher](https://github.com/Danncode10/Bootstrap-Refresher-UI-Building-Lesson-Plan) first.

## 🧠 About This Course

This is a **2-week crash course** that teaches the fundamentals of modern JavaScript — with the twist of using **AI tools** like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to speed up learning and debugging.

Perfect for beginners like me who learn slowly but deeply, with lots of hands-on practice and clear explanations.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

I'm learning slowly but seriously. This course is the foundation of my journey to become a **full stack developer**.

After this, I will continue with:

1. **React** (Frontend)
2. **React Native** (Mobile)
3. **Node.js** (Backend)

This repo tracks my learning, mini projects, and progress.  
If you're learning too, feel free to fork or follow along!

Let’s get better together, one lesson at a time. 💻✨
